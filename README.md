### Hello World! 👋

**Principal Software Architect** | 20+ years building enterprise systems

## About Me

I design and develop enterprise applications with focus on design quality and long-term maintainability. I apply Domain-Driven Design, Event Sourcing, and Clean Architecture in complex contexts. When I'm not architecting systems, you'll find me diving into philosophy, quantum consciousness, and how they intersect with computational intelligence.

## Current Focus

- 🤖 **Agentic AI** integration for development workflows
- 📖 **Documentation as Code** for product governance

## Code Philosophy

I'm a profound supporter of **Literate Coding**, believing that code should not only work but also communicate. Just as a well-written book immerses its reader, great software should guide its audience—developers, architects, or stakeholders—through its logic and design with elegance and simplicity. The true artistry lies in making the complex accessible.
